"""Track 1 verifier and scorer.

Architecture
------------
Track 1 inherits the shared HierarchicalVerifier gate chain (g0-g2) from
qfbench2_common.verifier and provides a T1-specific g3 implementation plus a
pass@k scorer.

Two legacy QFBench verifier patterns are unified here:

Plain-pytest pattern (binary reward)
    The existing majority of QFBench tasks use pytest checks that exit 0 (pass)
    or non-zero (fail).  In T1 v2, the pytest result maps directly to
    g3_domain_semantics: pass → admissible (score computed), fail → inadmissible
    (score=None, label T1_INVARIANT_VIOLATION or T1_WRONG_NUMERIC).

DI-verifier pattern (multi-phase partial credit + root-cause labels)
    The legacy "DI verifier" assigned partial scores and emitted detailed labels
    (T1_CONVENTION_ERROR, T1_MISLABELING).  In T1 v2 the DI labels are
    preserved as diagnostics for the cross-track failure map, but partial credit
    is NOT used for leaderboard ranking.  The DI label pass runs AFTER g3
    clears (i.e., only on admissible attempts) and writes its labels to the
    failure-map JSONL without changing the reward.

Leaderboard ranking
    Official: mean pass@1 across the signed roster, ONE execution per task, fixed denominator,
    no confidence interval (ruled 2026-09-03). pass@3 and bootstrap CIs exist only in the
    offline Harbor development report (`qfbench2 track1 score-harbor-job`).
    LEADERBOARD_SORT = "desc" (higher is better).

    Why: on the platform `score.py` scores every unit with `output_dir = res/<unit>`, never
    `/app/output`, and 48 of the 87 Development units' checks hardcode `/app/output` (measured
    2026-09-10). Until this existed the scorer refused those units as ``not_redirectable`` and
    `_g3_domain_semantics` filed the refusal as the PARTICIPANT's `T1_WRONG_NUMERIC`, so on 48
    units a correct solution was labelled exactly like a placeholder, for every team.

    How: a COPY of the output tree into the named directory, which the scorer either creates
    (and removes afterwards) or finds already there and EMPTY (and empties afterwards). The
    second case is the platform's, not an edge case: the vendored CodaBench worker binds the
    scoring program's own output directory at `/app/output` for every scoring container
    (`compute_worker.py`, `volumes_config[...] = {"bind": "/app/output"}`), that directory is
    a fresh, empty one for every run, and `score.py` writes nothing into it until the unit loop
    has finished. The first version of this function refused any pre-existing path, which on
    the platform turned "48 units scored as participant zero" into "the whole evaluation
    aborted as an organizer fault, nothing scored" -- caught in review before it shipped, never
    deployed. A symlink cannot do the platform case at all (a bind mount cannot be replaced),
    per-entry symlinks would hide subdirectories from `os.walk` and `Path.rglob` (one public
    unit rglobs its output), and a bind mount needs privileges the container may not have.

    Precondition, held by the roster tests, not by this code: the checks READ the output, they
    never execute it (see `_EXECUTION_CALL_RE`). Given that, everything below the copy is
    organizer material and raises `OrganizerFault`, which scores nobody: a path that is a
    symlink, a file or a populated directory (never touched -- it could be a real mount), a
    parent or directory that cannot be created, a copy that fails on a tree already checked to
    be copyable, or a path that is no longer the directory this scorer populated when the
    checks finish (left in place). What IS the submission's -- an output tree that cannot be
    copied because of what it contains -- raises `_UnpresentableOutput` before anything is
    touched, and `_run_trusted_checks` files that with the submission.

    Known window, documented rather than closed: a process a unit's checks leave running past
    pytest's exit can read the NEXT unit's presentation through the same path. Same submission,
    organizer-owned checks; the precondition above is what keeps it that way. A leftover
    process that WRITES into the bound path after the restoration makes the NEXT hardcoded
    unit an `OrganizerFault` (`_claim_presentation_dir` finds the root populated), which is
    the intended loud failure: nothing is scored against a presentation that is not the
    scorer's own.
