"""This repo requires the harness to bind the run output directory at BOTH output paths.

    python tests/test_output_dir_contract.py

Stdlib-only, unit-data-only: no pytest, no Docker, no toolkit import, so it runs in the lint job.

Track 1 inherits QFBench/Harbor, which puts agent deliverables in ``/app/output``; the rest of
Agenthon uses a bare ``/output``. Both spellings are live here, and the units are *internally*
consistent -- each one's instruction.md and checks agree with each other. They just do not all
agree with each other ACROSS units:

* 48 of 87 ``checks/test_outputs.py`` read a hardcoded ``/app/output`` with no env fallback;
* 39 resolve ``os.environ["OUTPUT_DIR"]`` (which ``checks/test.sh`` sets), defaulting to a
  hardcoded literal if it is unset;
* 82 of 87 ``instruction.md`` name ``/app/output``, 6 name ``/output``.

These counts are measured AFTER the 2026-08-27 relative-path fix. Before it, 19 instruction.md
named a bare ``./output`` and the numbers above read 63 / 5 / 19 — see
``test_no_unit_names_a_relative_output_directory`` for why that was invisible here.

The CodaBench harness originally bound the run's output directory at ``/output`` only, while
passing ``solve --task-dir /input --out /output``. That is silent and total: an agent obeying its
own instruction.md writes ``/app/output``, which is an ordinary directory inside the container;
``--rm`` deletes it; ``res/<unit>/`` is empty; ``_g1_schema`` fails with "reward.json not found";
the unit scores 0 -- not for a bad agent, but for every agent, indistinguishably from genuinely
failing the hidden tests.

The harness now binds one host directory at both container paths, which
fixes all 87 units without editing any of them. These tests are the standing proof that the
second bind is load-bearing and cannot be dropped: they enumerate, from the unit data itself,
which paths this repo actually requires.
